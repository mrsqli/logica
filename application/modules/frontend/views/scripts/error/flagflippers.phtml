<h1>Flag and Flipper error</h1>
<p>
    Hey there fellow developer :)
</p>
<p>
    You've requested action <code><?php echo $this->originalAction;?></code> in controller <code><?php echo $this->originalController;?></code>. Sadly I must inform you that this resource / privilege combination isn't registered in the database and I can't to a proper Flag and Flipper query on it. This is the reason you're seing this error.
</p>
<p>
    I suggest you use the command line tool - located at <code>application/modules/backoffice/cli/tools/FlagFlipper.php</code> - and generate the necessary SQL queries, run them and add them to the DB changes file.
</p>
<p>
    PS: don't panic, this happens only in dev. Staging / production users will get the 404 page. Don't feel left out, you can always <a href="<?php echo $this->baseUrl();?>/error/404/" title="">click here</a> and experience the 404 page.
